### Mini Web Server

Although many applications will run perfectly well when loaded via a `file://`
URL, browser security means that some applications *must* use an `http://` url. 
The CLI includes the `qx serve` command which operates a mini web server running
(by default) on `http://localhost:8080`.  You can customise the port with the
`--listenPort=<portnumber>` argument, or by adding `serve: { listenPort:
<portnumber> }` to your `compile.json`; the command line option will take
precedence over the `compile.json` setting.

An important feature is that `qx serve` will constantly compile your application
in the background, every time you edit the code - this is equivalent to `qx
compile --watch` plus the web server.

As an example this will compile your application and start the web server on port 8082 

```
$ qx serve --listenPort=8082
```


```
qx serve [configFile]

Note that the `qx serve` command supports exactly the same options as `qx
compile`, with the exception of `--watch` because that is always enabled; for
more details of the options and the compilation process, please see
